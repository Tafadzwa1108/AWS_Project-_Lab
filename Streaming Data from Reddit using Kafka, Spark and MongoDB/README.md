<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">
In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, TechInsight Solutions grapples with the challenge of efficiently leveraging real-time insights from Reddit, a vital source of user-generated content. 

The absence of a streamlined solution hinders the organization from tapping into valuable market intelligence, conducting brand perception analysis, and enhancing customer engagement. To address this, our project aims to develop a scalable streaming data pipeline. This solution will seamlessly integrate Reddit data into TechInsight Solutions' analytics ecosystem, facilitating timely and data-driven decision-making for heightened competitiveness and market responsiveness.

<h1 align="left">Project Rationale </h1>
<p>
In this data engineering project, our primary objective is to establish a seamless streaming data pipeline. By leveraging the Reddit API and Kafka integration, we plan to continuously collect and funnel real-time subreddits into a Kafka topic. The heart of our real-time processing lies in Apache Spark Streaming, where we intend to conduct critical tasks like text preprocessing, language detection, and sentiment analysis using machine learning models. Data will be securely stored, in a NoSQL Database

Ultimately, this data pipeline equips organizations with the power to stay ahead in today's dynamic digital landscape by making informed decisions based on real-time data ingestion. It enhances customer engagement, assists in product development, and provides a competitive edge through the integration of robust architecture, data security, and efficient data processing capabilities.
